# MY472 - Data for Data Scientists

## Problem Set 1, MT2018
---

The goal of assignment 1 is to make sure you know how to work with GitHub Classroom in order to access, complete, and submit assignments.

**Deadline:** Submission not required

1. Get started with GitHub

    * Install GitHub Desktop if you haven't already. If you are having trouble, follow the instructions here: https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started-with-github-desktop/
  
    * Set up an account with GitHub.
  
2. Clone the [lectures repository](https://github.com/lse-my472/lectures) and compile the RMarkdown files for week 1.

    * You can "clone" the repository using the buttons found to the right side of your browser window as you view this repository.  This is the button labelled "Clone in Desktop".
  
    * After compiling the RMarkdown file, practice staging and pushing the compiled files to your own (forked) version of that repository.
  
3. Practice the GitHub classroom workflow.

    *  Access the GitHub Classroom for assignment 1 through:

          [LINK TO BE UPDATED](LINK TO BE UPDATED)

       Click on "accept this assignment" to set up the repository for this part of the assignment.  

    *  Write your personal information on `information.md` and then commit the file.
    
    * Fix the RMarkdown file `RMarkdown-practice.Rmd` so that it can be compiled. Stage, commit, and push this change.

Congratulations, you are finished!
