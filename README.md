# MY472 - Data for Data Scientists

## Problem Set 1
---

The goal of this first problem set is to make sure you know how to work with GitHub Classroom in order to access, complete, and submit assignments. You will not be evaluated on this assignment.

**Deadline:** Submission not required

1. Get started with GitHub

    *  Install GitHub Desktop if you haven't already. If you are having trouble, follow the instructions here: https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started-with-github-desktop/
  
    *  Set up an account with GitHub.
  
2. Fork and clone the [MY472 home page repository](https://github.com/lse-my472/lse-my472.github.io).

    *  You can "fork" the repository using the "Fork" button in the upper right.  This will copy a version of this repository to a "fork" repo that will be created in your GitHub account.
    
    *  Now "clone" the repository using the buttons found to the right side of your browser window as you view this repository.  This is the button labelled "Clone in Desktop", and will create a (local) copy on your local drive.
    
        You could also have done this from a terminal window on your local machine using
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/lse-my472/lse-my472.github.io
        ```
  
    *  Knit the two `.Rmd` files, which will result in two new `.html` files.  After compiling the RMarkdown file, practice staging and pushing the compiled files to your own (forked) version of that repository.

  
3. Practice the GitHub classroom workflow.

    *  Access the GitHub Classroom for assignment 1 through:

          [https://classroom.github.com/a/CSEdQujE](https://classroom.github.com/a/ CSEdQujE)

       Click on "accept this assignment" to set up the repository for this part of the assignment.  

    *  Write your personal information on `information.md` and then commit the file.
    
    *  Fix the RMarkdown file `RMarkdown-practice.Rmd` so that it can be compiled. Stage, commit, and push this change.

Congratulations, you are finished!

4.  OPTIONAL: Create a personal web page.

    *  Clone a website repository, modify it, and publish a personal webpage.  You can follow the steps described in:

    Jim McGlone, "[Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub:
     A step-by-step beginner's guide to creating a personal website and blog using Jekyll and hosting it for free using GitHub Pages.](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)".
